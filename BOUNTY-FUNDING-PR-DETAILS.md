Collaborative Bounty Escrow Funding: Enable Community-Driven Security Research Incentives
```

---

## Pull Request Description

### Overview
This PR introduces a sophisticated bounty escrow funding system that empowers the security research community to collaboratively fund bounty rewards, fostering broader participation in vulnerability discovery programs.

### Key Features Implemented

#### Community-Driven Funding Architecture
- **Multi-contributor Support**: Multiple users can contribute STX tokens toward specific bounty rewards, enabling community pooling of resources for high-value security research initiatives
- **Transparent Contribution Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of individual contributions with timestamps and amounts for full auditability
- **Funding Progress Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of funding completion percentage and remaining amounts needed

#### Flexible Withdrawal Mechanisms  
- **Pre-funding Withdrawals**: Contributors can reclaim their STX tokens from bounties that haven't reached full funding status
- **Anti-lock Protection**: Prevents funds from being permanently locked in unfunded bounties through accessible withdrawal functionality

#### Advanced Funding Analytics
- **Completion Percentage Calculation**: Mathematical precision in determining how close bounties are to full funding
- **Contributor Statistics**: Detailed metrics on number of contributors and individual contribution amounts
- **Funding Summary Reports**: Comprehensive funding status overview including remaining needed amounts

### Technical Implementation

#### New Contract: `bounty-escrow-funding.clar`
- **164 lines of Clarity code** implementing robust funding mechanisms
- **Data Maps**: `bounty-contributions` and `bounty-funding-status` for comprehensive state management
- **Error Handling**: Six specific error codes covering all edge cases and failure scenarios
- **Read-only Functions**: Multiple query functions for funding status and contributor information

#### Integration with Existing Architecture
- **Contract Interoperability**: Seamless integration with existing bounty contract through contract-call functionality
- **State Consistency**: Maintains data integrity across both contracts while preserving existing functionality
- **Backward Compatibility**: Zero impact on current bounty creation and submission workflows

### Functions Overview

#### Public Functions
- `initialize-bounty-funding`: Setup funding tracking for new bounties
- `fund-bounty`: Process STX contributions toward bounty rewards  
- `withdraw-contribution`: Allow contributors to reclaim unfunded contributions

#### Read-only Functions
- `get-funding-status`: Retrieve comprehensive funding progress information
- `get-contributor-info`: Access individual contribution details and timestamps
- `get-funding-percentage`: Calculate precise funding completion metrics
- `get-bounty-funding-summary`: Generate detailed funding analytics reports

### Security Considerations
- **STX Transfer Safety**: All token transfers utilize Clarity's built-in safety mechanisms with proper error handling
- **Access Control**: Withdrawal functions restricted to original contributors with proper authorization checks  
- **State Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and boundary condition checking throughout
- **Fund Protection**: Anti-double-funding measures and fully-funded bounty protection mechanisms

### Benefits for Security Research Ecosystem
- **Lower Barrier to Entry**: Researchers can participate in funding bounties without shouldering full reward costs
- **Community Engagement**: Encourages collaborative investment in security research initiatives
- **Funding Transparency**: Complete visibility into who funds bounties and contribution amounts
- **Risk Distribution**: Spreads financial risk across multiple community members rather than single entities

This enhancement transforms the bounty platform from individual-funded to community-collaborative, significantly expanding the potential scope and impact of security research incentives.

## Usage Examples

### Initialize Bounty Funding
```clarity
;; Setup community funding for bounty requiring 10 STX
(contract-call? .bounty-escrow-funding initialize-bounty-funding u1 u10000000)
```

### Contribute to Bounty
```clarity
;; Contribute 3 STX to bounty #1
(contract-call? .bounty-escrow-funding fund-bounty u1 u3000000)
```

### Check Funding Progress
```clarity
;; Get funding completion percentage
(contract-call? .bounty-escrow-funding get-funding-percentage u1)
;; Returns: (ok u30) - 30% funded

;; Get detailed funding summary
