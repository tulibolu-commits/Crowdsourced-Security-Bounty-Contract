Establish comprehensive rating framework for security researcher reputation tracking
```

## Pull Request Description

This enhancement introduces a sophisticated community-driven rating system that transforms the bounty platform into a comprehensive reputation-building ecosystem for security researchers.

### Key Changes Implemented

**Rating Infrastructure**
- Implemented `submission-ratings` map structure for storing community assessments with temporal metadata
- Created `user-reputation` tracking system that maintains aggregate scoring across all researcher activities
- Added validation mechanisms ensuring ratings fall within the 1-5 scale for consistent quality measurement

**Enhanced Submission Workflow**
- Modified `accept-submission` function to automatically initialize reputation tracking for new researchers
- Integrated reputation system initialization during the acceptance process for seamless user onboarding
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing bounty and submission management functions

**Community Assessment Functions**
- `rate-submission`: Enables community members to evaluate accepted solutions with comprehensive validation
- `get-user-reputation-score`: Calculates weighted average ratings across all researcher contributions  
- `get-user-reputation-details`: Provides detailed reputation metrics including submission counts and rating distributions
- `get-submission-rating`: Retrieves individual rating records for transparency and audit purposes

**Anti-Gaming Security Measures**
- Implemented one-rating-per-user-per-submission constraint to prevent reputation manipulation
- Added acceptance requirement validation ensuring only vetted solutions can receive community ratings
- Integrated block height timestamps for complete audit trail capabilities

### Technical Enhancements

**Error Handling Improvements**
- Added `ERR-ALREADY-RATED` (u104) for duplicate rating prevention
- Introduced `ERR-NOT-ACCEPTED` (u105) for submission status validation
- Enhanced error messaging for better developer experience

**Data Structure Optimizations**
- Composite key mapping ensures efficient rating storage and retrieval
- Reputation aggregation logic minimizes computational overhead during score calculations
- Temporal tracking enables future analytical capabilities for platform insights

### Impact Assessment

This rating system establishes the foundation for a self-regulating security research community where:
- High-quality vulnerability reports receive recognition through transparent peer evaluation
- Researchers build verifiable reputation portfolios that demonstrate their expertise and reliability
- Organizations can identify top-tier security talent based on historical performance metrics
- The platform maintains quality standards through community-driven assessment mechanisms

The implementation maintains gas efficiency while providing comprehensive functionality that scales with platform adoption. All reputation data remains permanently stored on-chain, creating an immutable record of researcher achievements.

### Future Compatibility

The rating architecture supports potential future enhancements including:
- Weighted voting based on rater reputation scores
- Time-decay mechanisms for maintaining rating relevance
- Category-specific rating systems for different vulnerability types
- Integration with external reputation platforms through standardized scoring interfaces

This enhancement positions the bounty platform as a premier destination for security research collaboration while establishing transparent quality standards that benefit both researchers and organizations seeking security expertise.
